## Usage
- Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yangxy/synthesizing_realistic_training_pairs.git
cd synthesizing_realistic_training_pairs
```

- Prepare LQ/HQ datasets, e.g., [DID_natural](https://public-vigen-video.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/robin/models/SR_models/did_natural_urls.txt)/[DF2K_OST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaihoa1476050/df2k-ost), and put them into ``datasets/``. Please send me email for DID_face dataset.

- Train a DDPM that generates realistic LQ images.
```bash
bash ./train_ddpm.sh
```

Download our pre-trained model [ddpm_did_256](https://public-vigen-video.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/robin/models/SR_models/checkpoint-50000.zip) trained with a resolution of ``256x256``. 

- (Optional) Extrat HQ images to subimages in order to match your train size.
```bash
python scripts/extract_subimages.py # change the values of opt, especially opt['input_folder']/opt['save_folder'] accordingly
```

- Synthesize realistic LQ images with the help of the pre-trained DDPM.
```bash
python test_ddpm_img2img.py --max_strength 0.2
```

- Train your own SR models using the synthesized HQ-LQ pairs

- Test your SR model.

You can download our pre-trained models [RRDB+](https://public-vigen-video.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/robin/models/SR_models/RRDB%2B.pth). 

#### We re-train our models due to the whole project is re-builed on [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers). The outputs may differ from the results presented in the paper. We are still working on it and the released models woule be updated at any time.
